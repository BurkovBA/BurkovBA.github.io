description: In this post I'll briefly cover the multivariate analogues of gamma-distribution-related univariate statistical distributions.
---

Wishart distribution
--------------------

Wishart distribution is a multivariate analogue of Chi-square distribution. 

TODO

Matrix Gamma distribution
-------------------------

Matrix Gamma distribution to Wishart distribution in multivariate case is what gamma distribution is to Chi-square distribution
in univariate case. 

TODO

Hotelling T-squared distribution
--------------------------------

Multivariate analogue of t-Student. 

TODO


Wilks' Lambda distribution
--------------------------

Wilks' Lambda distribution to Hotelling T-squared distribution in multivarite case is what t-Student distribution is to
Snedecor-Fisher's F distribution.
