description: In my university days I used to attend a course of quantum chemistry/mechanics, which was given in a typical post-soviet education style. All formalism, no essentials. As quantum computers are getting closer and closer to the reality by the day, I had a practical reason to finally improve my understanding of the theory. Here is my roadmap to understanding the quantum mechanics.

Lagrangian mechanics
--------------------


### Action and principle of minimal action: Leibniz, Maupertuis, D'Alembert's and Hamilton's

More of a philosophical then practical origin. Leibniz.

"Nature is parsimonious."

$S = \int \limits_{t_1}^{t_2} L(t) dt$, where $S$ is the total action, and $L(t)$ is the unit of change of action through
an infinitesimal period of time.

TODO

### Configuration space and generalized coordinates for constrained optimization

Remember, Lagrange was known for the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Example: Body, attached to a wire.

TODO

### Calculus of variations
 
TODO

### Lagrangian

$S = \int \limits_{x_1}^{x_2} L(f(x, \dot{x}, t)) dt $

$L = T - U$

Why Lagrangian was chosen the way it was chosen? 4 criteria.

TODO

### Noether's theorem

Every law of conservation (e.g. conservation of momentum, energy etc.) corresponds to some symmetry (e.g. translational
symmetry of time, space etc.).

TODO

Hamiltonian mechanics
---------------------
 - Phase space vs configuration space, Legendre transform
 - Hamiltonian vs Lagrangian

Basics of physics for quantum mechanics
---------------------------------------
 - Planck constant as quantum of action
