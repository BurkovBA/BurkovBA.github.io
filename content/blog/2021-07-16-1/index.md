description: In my university days I used to attend a course of quantum chemistry/mechanics, which was read in the typical post-soviet education style. All formalism, no essentials. As quantum computers are getting closer and closer to the reality by the day, I had a practical reason to finally improve my understanding of the theory. Here is my roadmap to understanding of quantum mechanics.

Lagrangian mechanics

 - Action
 - Configuration space and generalized coordinates for constrained optimization
 - D'Alembert's and Hamilton's principles
 - Calculus of variations
