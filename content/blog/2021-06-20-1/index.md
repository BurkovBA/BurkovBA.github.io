description: Here I discuss, how to derive Student's t-distribution, an important statistical distribution, used as a basis for t-test.

Student's t-distribution is yet another important distribution, associated with Chi-squared distribution. For the 
derivation of chi-squared distribution see [one of my previous posts](/2021-06-09-1).

William Sealy Gosset, known as "Studemt" used to work at the Guinness brewery and was interested in working with small
datasets. He was not allowed to publish his findings under his real name, but was allowed to publish the resluts of his 
research under a pseudonym. Having been an attendant of Karl Pearson's courses, he chose the fictional name "Student".
