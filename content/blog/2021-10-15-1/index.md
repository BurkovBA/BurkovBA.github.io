description: I perceive functional analysis as an infinite-dimensional generalization of linear algebra. While spectral decomposition of a matrix is relatively straightforward in finite-dimensional case, things are more complicated in case of operators. Operators have a spectrum, which is a generalization of the notion of eigenvalues. Here I provide a brief summary of the parts of operator spectrum, especially spectrum of self-adjoint operators, crucial for quantum mechanics. I will also briefly address compact operators and separable spaces, as they are convenient to work with due to discrete nature of their basis.
