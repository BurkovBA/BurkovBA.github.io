description: Quite often in mathematical statistics I run into Extreme Value Distribution - an analogue of Central Limit Theorem, which describes the distribution of maximum/minimum, observed in a series of i.i.d random variable tosses. In this post I explore the three cases of EVD and the Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem.

## 1. Problem statement and Generalized Extreme Value distribution

One of the most famous results in probabilities is Central Limit Theorem, which claims that sum of $n \to \infty$ i.i.d. random variables $\xi_i$
after centering and normalizing converges to Gaussian distribution.

Now, what if we ask a similar question about maximum of those $n \to \infty$ i.i.d. random variables instead of sum? Does it converge to any distribution?

Turns out that it depends on the properties of the distribution $\xi_i$, but not much really. Regardless of the distribution
of $\xi_i$ the distribution of maximum of $n$ random variables $\xi_i$ is:

$G_{\gamma}(x) = exp(-(1 + \gamma x)^{-\frac{1}{\gamma}})$

This distribution is called **Generalized Extreme Value Distribution**. Depending on the coefficient $\gamma$ it can take
one of three specific forms:

#### Type I: Gumbel distribution

If $\gamma \to 0$, we can assume that $k = \frac{1}{\gamma} \to \infty$. Then generalized EVD converges to a
doubly-exponential distribution (sometimes this is called a law of double logarithm) by definition of $e = (1 + \frac{1}{k})^k$ and $e^x = (1 + \frac{1}{k}x)^k$:

$G_{\gamma}(x) = exp(-(1 + \gamma x)^{-\frac{1}{\gamma}}) = exp(-(1 + \frac{1}{k} x)^{-k}) = exp(-e^{-x})$.

This is Gumbel distribution, it oftentimes occurs in various areas, e.g. bioinformatics, describing the distribution
of longest series of successes in coin tosses in $n$ experiments of tossing a coin 100 times.

#### Type II: Frechet distribution

If $\gamma > 0$, let us denote $k = \frac{1}{\gamma}$ (k > 0). Then distribution takes the shape:

$G_{\gamma}(x) = exp(-(\frac{x}{\lambda})^{-k})$

This is Frechet distribution. It arises when the tails of the original cumulative distribution function 
$F_{\xi}(x)$ are heavy, e.g. when it is Pareto distribution.

#### Type III: Reversed Weibull distribution

If $\gamma < 0$, let us denote $k = -\frac{1}{\gamma}$ (k > 0, different kinds of behaviour are observed at $0 < k < 1$, $k = 1$ and $k > 1$), $\lambda = \frac{1}{ \frac{1}{x}+\gamma}$. Then distribution takes the shape:

$G_{\gamma}(x) = exp(-(\frac{x}{\lambda})^{k})$.

This is Weibull distribution. It often occurs in [survival analysis](http://localhost:8000/2021-06-11-1/) as a hazard 
rate function. It also arises in mining - there it describes the mass distribution of particles of size $x$ and is closely connected
to Pareto distribution. We shall discuss this connection later.

Generalized extreme value distribution converges to Weibull, when distribution of our random variable $\xi$ is bounded.
E.g. consider uniform distribution $\xi \sim U(0, 1)$. It is clear that the maximum of $n$ uniformly distributed
variables will be approaching 1 as $n \to \infty$. Turns out that the convergence rate is described by Weibull 
distribution.

## 2. Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem

Extreme Value Theorem is a series of theorems, proven in the first half of 20-th century. They claim that
maximum of several tosses of i.i.d. random variables converges to just one of 3 possible distributions,
Gumbel, Frechet or Weibull.

Here I will lay out the outline of the proof with my comments. The proof includes introduction of several
technical tools, but I will comment on their function and rationale behind each of them.

Consider a random variable $M_n$, which describes the distribution of maximum of $\xi_i$, $i \in 1..n$

$p(M_n \le x) = \prod \limits_{i=1}^{n} p(\xi_i \le x) = F^n(\xi_i \le x)$.

Similarly to the Central Limit Theorem, a convergence theorem might be applicable to the distribution of a 
normalized random variable $M_n$ rather than the non-normalized:

$p(\frac{M_n - b_n}{a_n} \le x) = p(M_n \le a_n x + b_n) = F^n(a_n x + b_n)$

We aim to show that for some series of constants $a_i$ and $b_i$ 

$F^n(a_n x + b_n)$ as $n \to \infty$ converges in distribution to some distribution $G(x)$: $F^n(a_n x + b_n) \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{w} G(x)$.

Now I will informally describe the proof outline, before introducing the mathematical formalism.

### General approach: max-stable distributions as invariants/fixed points/attractors and EVD types as equivalence classes 

I assume that all three types of Extreme Value Distribution were first discovered experimentally. Later statisticians 
came up with a proof that EVD can converge to just one of three possible types of distributions and no other types of 
EVD can exist. Finally, they came up with criteria for a distribution to belong to each type.

Design of this proof is similar to many other proofs. I will outline it informally here:

Assume that as the number of random variables $n \to \infty$ increases, approaching infinity, the distribution of the 
observed maximum approaches some type of distribution. Then such a distribution type can be considered as an invariant 
or attractor or fixed point, similar to many other mathematical problems. For instance, eigenvectors are fixed points 
of matrix multiplication. E.g. matrix eigenvector, multiplied by a matrix, results in itself, multiplied by a scalar. Or
no matter how many times you take a derivative of $e^{kx}$, you get $e^{kx}$, multiplied by a scalar $k$. 

Similarly, **maximum-stable distributions** are invariant objects. Those are distributions, maximum of i.i.d. variables 
of which converges to themselves, no matter how many more i.i.d. random variables you toss. E.g. if for one 
Gumbel-distributed random variable $\xi$ we know that $p_{\xi}(\frac{M_1 - b_1}{a_1} \le x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$, for $n \to \infty$ 
Gumbel-distributed random variables the maximum of $\xi_1.. \xi_n$ still is Gumbel-distributed (after centering and 
normalizing them by some numbers $a_n$, $b_n$): $p_{M_{n}}(\frac{M_n - b_n}{a_n} \le x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$.

Ok. Then after we established that there are some distributions, for which maximum of $n \to \infty$ centered and normalized 
i.i.d. variables produces a random variable with the same distribution, how do we show that all distributions converge
to one of them?

We'll use another classical mathematical tool: **equivalence classes** and **equivalence relation**. For instance,
odd numbers and even numbers form two equivalence classes under operation of modulo 2. Odd numbers are equivalent to
each other in terms of producing remainder 1 (e.g. $3 \sim 5$, where $\sim$ is equivalence relation of modulo 2), and even 
numbers are equivalent in terms of producing remainder 0.

Similarly, we will show that types of EVD form equivalence classes under the operation of finding maximum of $n \to \infty$
i.i.d. random variables with any distribution, and as a result all the distributions converge to one of those types. E.g.
Pareto's distribution is equivalent to Cauchy distribution under equivalence relation of convergence of maximum of 
$n \to \infty$ Pareto/Cauchy i.i.d's to the same maximum stable type II (Frechet) EVD.

Now that I've laid out the plan of the proof, it is time to get into technicalities. I will formally introduce the concepts
I mentioned above and prove some lemmas about their relatedness.

#### Definition 2.1: Max-stable cumulative distribution function

$G$ is max-stable if for all $n \in 1..N$  and for all x there exists $\{a_n\}, \{b_n\} \subset \mathbb{R}^+$ such that for all 
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ $G(x) = G_n(a_n x + b_n)$.

#### Definition 2.2: Domain of attraction

If $F$ is a cdf, then $F$ is in the domain of attraction (for maxima) of $G$, and it is written $F \in \mathcal{D}(G)$, 
when there exist sequences $\{a_n\}, \{b_n\} \subset \mathbb{R}^+$ such that $F^n (a_n x + b_n) \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{w} G(x)$.

#### Definition 2.3: Type of convergence

If $G^*(x)$ is another non-degenerate cdf, we say that $G$ and $G^*$ have the same type if for all $x$ there exist 
$a > 0$ and $b \in R$ such that for every x âˆˆ R $G^*(ax + b) = G(x)$.

#### Lemma 2.1: Khinchin's theorem (law of Convergence of Types)

Suppose that we have a sequence of distribution functions $\{F_n\}$ (e.g. the distributions of maximum of random variable $\xi_i$ in $n$ experiments).

Let those distribution functions upon $n \to \infty$ converge to a certain distribution $G(x)$: $F_n(a_n x + b_n) \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{w} G(x)$. Then we have two series of constants $\{a_n\}, \{b_n\}$.

Suppose there is another distribution function $H(x)$ such that the sequence of distributions $F_n(\alpha_n x + \beta_n)$ converges to that function: $F_n(\alpha_n x + \beta_n) \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{w} H(x)$ and there is a different pair of series $\{ \alpha_n \}, \{\beta_n \}$.

Then $H(x) = G(Ax + B)$ and $A = \frac{\alpha_n}{a_n}$, $B = \frac{\beta_n - b_n}{a_n}$.

#### Proof:

Consider two distribution functions $G(x)$ and $H(x)$, such that for every $x$: $y = F(ax+b)$ and $y = F(\alpha x + \beta)$.

Denote $y = F(ax + b) \to G(x)$. Then $F^{-1}(y) = ax + b$ and $x = \frac{F^{-1}(y) - b}{a} \to G^{-1}(y)$.

Similarly $y = F(\alpha x + \beta) \to H(x)$ and $F^{-1}(y) = \alpha x + \beta$ and $x = \frac{F^{-1}(y) - \beta}{\alpha} \to H^{-1}(y)$.

Now choose two points: $x_1$, corresponding to $y_1$, and $x_2$, corresponding to $y_2$ and subtract $x_1$ and $x_2$ from each other:

$x_1 - x_2 = \frac{F^{-1}(y_1) - F^{-1}(y_2)}{a} \to G^{-1}(y_1) - G^{-1}(y_2)$

Apply the same for $H^{-1}$:

$x_1 - x_2 = \frac{F^{-1}(y_1) - F^{-1}(y_2)}{\alpha} \to H^{-1}(y_1) - H^{-1}(y_2)$

Which results in $\frac{G^{-1}(y_1) - G^{-1}(y_2)}{H^{-1}(y_1) - H^{-1}(y_2)} \to \frac{\alpha}{a} = A$.

Substitute $\alpha = A \cdot a$ into $H^{-1}(y) \to x = \frac{F^{-1}(y) - \beta}{A \cdot a}$ and $A \cdot H^{-1}(y) \to A \cdot x = \frac{F^{-1}(y) - \beta}{a}$.

On the other hand we recall that $G^{-1}(y) \to x = \frac{F^{-1}(y) - b}{a}$. Subtracting these, we get: $A \cdot H^{-1}(y) - G^{-1}(y) \to \frac{F^{-1}(y) - \beta}{a} - \frac{F^{-1}(y) - b}{a} = \frac{b - \beta}{a}$ or $\frac{\beta - b}{a} = B \to G^{-1}(y) - A \cdot H^{-1}(y)$.

Hence, $G^{-1}(y) \to A \cdot H^{-1}(y) + B$.


#### Lemma 2.2: Necessary condition of maximum-stability

Given G a non-degenerate cdf:

1. G is max-stable if and only if there exists a sequence $\{F_n\}$ of cdf â€™s and sequences
$\{a_n\} \subset \mathbb{R}^+$, $\{b_n\}$ such that for all $k \in N$ $F_n(a_{nk} x + b_{nk}) \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{w} G^{1/k}(x)$

2. $\mathcal{D}(G) \neq 0$ if and only if $G$ is max-stable. In that case, $G \in \mathcal{D}(G)$.

#### Proof: 

##### Proposition 1 direct statement: if $G$ is max-stable, there exists $\{F_n\}$ such that ...

If $G$ is max-stable, then by definition for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there exist $a_n$, $b_n$, such that $G^{n}(a_n x + b_n) = G(x)$.

Define $F_n = G^n$. Then $F^k_n(a_{nk} x + b_{nk}) = G^{nk}(a_{nk} x + b_{nk}) = G$. We arrive at the direct statement.

##### Proposition 1 reverse statement: if $G$ is max-stable, there exists $\{F_n\}$ such that ... 

Let us proof the reverse statement: suppose that the sequences $\{F^n\}$, $\{a_n\}$, $\{b_n\}$ exist, such that for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$:

$F_n(a_{nk}x + b_{nk}) \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{w} G^{1/k}(x)$

Then consider $k=1$ and $k=2$:

$F_n(a_{n}x + b_{n}) \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{w} G(x)$ and $F_n(a_{2n}x + b_{2n}) \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{w} G^{1/2}(x)$

By Khinchin's lemma there exists $G(\alpha_2 x+ \beta_2) = G^{1/2}(x)$. 

Similarly, for every other $k$: $G(\alpha_k x + \beta_k) = G^{1/k}(x)$ or $G^k(\alpha_k x + \beta_k) = G(x)$, which is the 
definition of max-stability.

##### Proposition 2 direct statement: 

The proof is self-evident: if G is max-stable, $G^n(a_n x + b_n) = G(x)$, and $G \in \mathcal{D}(G)$ by defintion.

##### Proposition 2 reverse statement: 

Assume $F \in \mathcal{D}(G)$, i.e. $F^n (a_n x + b_n) \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{w} G(x)$.

For all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ we have $F^{nk} (a_{nk} x + b_{nk}) \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{w} G(x)$.

Hence, $F^{n} (a_{nk} x + b_{nk}) \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{w} G^{1/k}(x)$

This makes $G$ and $G^k$ fit for the conditions of previous result, proving that $G$ is max-stable.

#### Corollary 2.1:

Let $G$ be a max-stable cdf. Then there exist functions $a(s) > 0$ and $b(s)$ such that for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$, for all $s > 0$, 
$G^s(a(s)x + b(s)) = G(x)$.

Corollary is self-evident from inversion of indices $s = \frac{1}{k}$.


#### Theorem 2.1: Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem (Extreme Value Theorem)

Let $\xi_i$ be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables.

If there exist constants $a_n > 0$, $b_n \in \mathbb{R}$ and some
non-degenerate cumulative distribution function $G$ such that $\frac{M_n - b_n}{a_n} \sim G$, then $G$ is one of these:

(Type I) Gumbel: $G(x) = exp(-e^{-x})$, $x \in \mathbb{R}$,

(Type II) Frechet: $G(x) = exp(-x^{-\alpha})$, $x \ge 0, \alpha > 0$,

(Type III) Reversed Weibull: $G(x) = exp(-(-x)^{\alpha})$, $x \le 0, \alpha > 0$.

#### Proof

##### Step 1.

Consider double negative logarithm of max-stable distribution $G(a(s)x + b(s))^s = G(x)$.

$-\ln(-\ln(G(a(s)x + b(s))^{s})) = -\ln( -s \cdot \ln(G(a(s)x + b(s)))) = -\ln(-\ln(G(a(s)x + b(s)))) - \ln s = -\ln(-\ln G(x))$

##### Step 2.

Denote $\phi(x) = -\ln(-\ln(G(x)))$. Then from previous $\phi(a(s)x + b(s)) - \ln s = \phi(x)$.

##### Step 3. 

Denote $y = \phi(x)$. Apply $\phi^{-1}$ to both sides. We get: $\phi^{-1}(\phi(a(s)x + b(s))) = y + \ln s$.

$a(s)x + b(s) = \phi^{-1}(y + \ln s)$

$a(s) \phi^{-1}(y) + b(s) = \phi^{-1}(y + \ln s)$

$\phi^{-1}(y) = \frac{\phi^{-1}(y + \ln s) - b(s)}{a(s)}$

##### Step 4. 

Note that $\phi^{-1}(0) = \frac{\phi^{-1}(\ln s) - b(s)}{a(s)}$. Subtract $\phi^{-1}(0)$ from both sides:

$\phi^{-1}(y) - \phi^{-1}(0) = \frac{\phi^{-1}(y + \ln s) - b(s)}{a(s)} - \frac{\phi^{-1}(\ln s) - b(s)}{a(s)} = \frac{\phi^{-1}(y + \ln s) - \phi^{-1}(\ln s)}{a(s)}$

##### Step 5.

Substitute variables: $\psi^{-1}(y) = \phi^{-1}(y) - \phi^{-1}(0)$, $z = \ln s$, $\tilde a(z) = a(e^z)$. Then:

$\psi^{-1}(y) = \phi^{-1}(y) - \phi^{-1}(0) = \frac{\phi^{-1}(y + \ln s) - \phi^{-1}(\ln s)}{a(s)} = \frac{\psi^{-1}(y + z) - \psi^{-1}(z)}{\tilde a(z)}$

$\psi^{-1}(y + z) - \psi^{-1}(z) = \psi^{-1}(y) \tilde a(z)$

##### Step 6.

We can swap $y$ and $z$ in previous equation, settings $y = z$ and $z = y$:

$\psi^{-1}(y + z) - \psi^{-1}(y) = \psi^{-1}(z) \tilde a(y)$

After that subtract $\psi^{-1}(y + z) - \psi^{-1}(z) = \psi^{-1}(y) \tilde a(z)$ from $\psi^{-1}(y + z) - \psi^{-1}(y) = \psi^{-1}(z) \tilde a(y)$:

$\psi^{-1}(z) - \psi^{-1}(y) = \psi^{-1}(z) \tilde a(y) - \psi^{-1}(y) \tilde a(z)$

$\psi^{-1}(z) (1 - \tilde a(y)) = \psi^{-1}(y) (1 - \tilde a(z))$

Here we consider two cases.

##### Step 7a.

If $\tilde{a}(z) = 1$, previous equation leads us to $0 = 0$. But then let's substitute $\tilde{a}(z) = 1$ into the result of step 5:

$\psi^{-1}(y + z) = \psi^{-1}(y) + \psi^{-1}(z)$

This means that $\psi^{-1}(y) = \rho y$ and denoting $\nu = \phi^{-1}(0)$, we get:

$\rho y = \psi^{-1}(y) = \phi^{-1}(y) - \phi^{-1}(0) = \phi^{-1}(y) - \nu$

$\phi^{-1}(y) = \nu + \rho y$

$x = \phi^{-1}(\phi(x)) = \nu + \rho \ln(-\ln(-G(x)))$

$G(x) = exp(-e^{-\frac{x - \nu}{\rho}})$, which is Gumbel (Type I) EVD.

##### Step 7b.

If $\tilde{a}(z) \ne 1$: 

$\psi^{-1}(y) = \frac{ \psi^{-1}(z) }{ (1 - \tilde a(z)) } (1 - \tilde a(y)) = c (1 - \tilde a(y))$

Now recall that $\psi^{-1}(y + z) - \psi^{-1}(z) = \psi^{-1}(y) \tilde a(z)$ and substitute $\psi^{-1}(y) = c (1 - \tilde a(y))$ there:

$c (1 - \tilde{a}(y + z)) - c (1 - \tilde{a}(y)) = c (1 - \tilde{a}(y)) \tilde a(z)$

This leads us to equation $\tilde{a}(z + y) = \tilde{a}(y) \tilde{a}(z)$, which, upon monotonous $\tilde{a}(y)$ has a
solution $\tilde{a}(y) = e^{\rho y}$. Hence:

$\psi^{-1}(y) = c (1 - e^{\rho y}) = \phi^{-1}(y) - \phi^{-1}(0)$

$\phi^{-1}(y) = \nu + c (1 - e^{\rho y})$, where $\nu = \phi^{-1}(0)$.

Now recall that $\phi(x) = -\ln(-\ln(G(x)))$, and we get: $x = \phi^{-1}(\phi(x)) = \nu + c (1 - e^{-\rho \ln(-\ln(G(x)))})$. Hence: 

$\frac{x - \nu}{c} = 1 - (-\ln G(x))^{-\rho}$ 

$(-\ln G(x))^{-\rho} = 1 - \frac{x - \nu}{c}$

$-\ln G(x) = (1 - \frac{x - \nu}{c})^{-\frac{1}{\rho}}$

$G(x) = e^{-(1 - \frac{x - \nu}{c})^{-\frac{1}{\rho}}}$, which is either a Frechet (Type II), or a reversed Weibull (Type III) EVD.

## 3. Von Mises sufficient conditions for a distribution to belong to a type I, II or III

The Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem is an important theoretical result, but it does not provide an answer to the basic
question: what type of EVD does our distribution function $F$ belong to?

Fortunately, there are two sets of criteria that let us determine the domain of attraction of $F$. First, there are
von Mises conditions, which are sufficient, but not necessary. Still, they are more intuitive and give a good insight
into what kinds of distributions converge to what types of EVD and why. Second, there are general sufficient and 
necessary conditions. Proving them is a much more technical task and requires some extra preliminaries.

We will start with von Mises conditions, postulated by Richard von Mises in 1936, 7 years before Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko
theorem was proved by Boris Gnedenko in 1943. Von Mises conditions are formulated in terms of survival analysis. We shall 
introduce some basic notions from survival analysis first.

### Pre-requisites from survival analysis

#### Definition 3.1: Survival function

**Survival function** $S(t)$ is reverse of cumulative distribution function $F(t)$: $S(t) = 1 - F(t)$.

Basically, if our random variable's value represents a human longevity, cumulative distribution funcion
$F(t) = p(\xi \le t) = \int \limits_{-\infty}^{t} f(x) dx$ represents the fraction of people, who die by the time $t$.

Survival function $S(t) = p(\xi \ge t) = 1 - p(\xi \le t) = 1 - F(t)$ on the contrary is the fraction of people, who 
are still alive by the time $t$.

#### Proposition 3.1: integral of survival function equals to average life expectancy

Basically rotate survival function plot by 90 degrees to see that it is expectation of lifetime 
(just swap x and y axes and it becomes obvious).

#### Definition 3.2: Survival function end point

We shall denote the **end point** of survival function $x_F = \sup \{ x; F(x) < 1\}$. It is also sometimes denoted $\omega(F)$.

Basically, $x_F$ is the smallest point $x$, where survival function $S(x)$ becomes exactly 0. For instance, if we're 
studying the survival of human, and there are known survivors at the age of $128$, but everybody dies by the age of 129 years, $x_F = 129$.

If there is no such limit (e.g. the population dies out exponentially $S(x) = e^{-x}$ or 
polynomially $S(x) = \frac{1}{x}$), we say that $x_F = \infty$.

#### Definition 3.3: Tail quantile function

**Tail quantile function** of $n$ is the smallest time $t$, when the fraction of survivors becomes smaller than $n$:

$\gamma(n) = \inf \{ t; F(t) \le 1 - \frac{1}{n} \} = \inf \{ t; S(t) \ge \frac{1}{n} \}$

For instance, tail quantile function of 10 is the time, when 1/10 of population is still alive.

#### Lemma 3.1: convergence of tail quantile function to exponent

Consider a sequence $\{ x_n \}$ of data points, such that each $x_n \to t_n$ as $n \to \infty$, where $\{t_n\}$ are the 
values of tail quantile function at $\frac{\tau}{n}$:

$\gamma(\frac{\tau}{n}) = \inf \{t_n; S(t_n) \ge \frac{\tau}{n} \}$

Then $p(M_n \le x_n) \to e^{-\tau}$.

#### Proof:

$(1 - p(M_n \le x_n))^n = (1 - F(t_n))^n = S(t_n)^n = (1 - \frac{\tau}{n})^n  = e^{-\tau}$ (last equality by definition of exponent)

#### Definition 3.4: Hazard rate

**Hazard rate** $r(t)$ in the same context of survival analysis your chance of dying at the time $t$. 

Basically, what's your chances to die at 64, if you're an average person? It is the number of
people, who died aged 64, to number of people, who survived by 64. In mathematical terms it is the ratio of 
probability density function to survival function:

$r(t) = \frac{f(t)}{1 - F(t)} = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$

#### Definition 3.5: Cumulative hazard rate

**Cumulative hazard rate** $R(t) = \int \limits_{x=-\infty}^{t} r(x) dx$ is integral of hazard rate over some period of time.

Cumulative hazard rate is basically the number of times you avoided death by now. E.g. you're a cowboy in the Wild West,
robbing trains. At your first robbery your chance of being killed (hazard rate) is $1/2$. Then you get more experienced
and at the second and third time your hazard rate is $1/3$ and $1/4$. If you survived 3 robberies, your cumulative hazard
rate equals $1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4$. Basically, you "deserved" more than 1 death by now and are lucky to still be alive.

#### Proposition 3.1. Cumulative hazard rate relation to survival function

$R(t) = \int \limits_{-\infty}^{t} \frac{f(x)}{1 - F(x)} dx = - \int \limits_{-\infty}^{t} \frac{1}{1 - F(x)} d(1 - F(x)) = -\ln(1 - F(t)) = -\ln S(t)$.


### Von Mises conditions proofs

#### Theorem 3.1: Von Mises sufficient condition for a distribution to belong to type II (Frechet) EVD

If a distribution function $F_{\xi}$ has an infinite end point $x_F = \infty$ and 
$\lim \limits_{t \to \infty} r_{\xi}(t) \cdot t = \alpha$, then distribution $F_{\xi}$ belongs to type II (Frechet) EVD.

#### Proof:

Speaking informally, what we aim to show is that if hazard rate function $r_{\xi}(t)$ basically behaves as a hyperbolic function $\frac{\alpha}{t}$
as $t \to \infty$ (i.e. has a fat tail, decreasing much slower that $e^{-x}$), the corresponding cumulative distribution function $F_{\xi} \in \mathcal{D}(Frechet)$ is in the domain
of attraction $\mathcal{D}(Frechet)$ of Frechet (type II) EVD. 

I will drop indices $\xi$ under $r_{\xi}(t)$, $F_{\xi}(t)$ and $S_{\xi}(t)$ and will just write $r(t), F(t), S(t)$ in
context of our random variable $\xi$ in question.

We start the proof by recalling the connection between the cumulative hazard rate function $R(t)$ and survival function $S(x)$:

$-R(t) = -\int \limits_{x_1}^{x_2} r(t) dt = \ln S(x_2) - \ln S(x_1)$

Exponentiation of both sides gets us:

$e^{-{\int \limits_{x_1}^{x_2} r(t) dt}} = \frac{S(x_2)}{S(x_1)}$

Recalling that $r(t) \to \frac{\alpha}{t}$ upon $t \to \infty$ by the conditions of the theorem and $-\int \limits_{x_1}^{x_2} r(t)dt \to - \int \limits_{x_1}^{x_2} \frac{\alpha}{t} dt = - \alpha \cdot (\ln x_2 - \ln x_1)$:

$e^{-\alpha \cdot (\ln x_2 - \ln x_1)} = \frac{S(x_2)}{S(x_1)}$

Now take $x_1 = \gamma(n)$ (i.e. such a point in time, where survival function $S(x_1) = S(\gamma(n)) = 1/n$, we just experessed this 
through the tail quantile function $\gamma(n)$) and $x_2 = x \cdot x_1 = x \cdot \gamma(n)$ and substitute it into the previous line:

$e^{-\alpha \cdot (\ln (x \cdot \gamma(n)) - \ln \gamma(n))} = \frac{S(x \gamma(n))}{S(\gamma(n))}$

$e^{-\alpha \cdot (\ln x + \ln \gamma(n) - \ln \gamma(n))} = \frac{S(x \gamma(n))}{\frac{1}{n}}$

$e^{(\ln x)^{-\alpha}} = n S(x \gamma(n))$

$\frac{ x^{-\alpha} } { n }  = S(x \gamma(n)) = 1 - F(x \gamma(n))$ and $F(x \gamma(n)) = 1 - \frac{ x^{-\alpha} }{n}$

In other words $p(\xi_i \le x \gamma(n)) = 1 - \frac{ x^{-\alpha} }{n}$ or $p(\max \xi_i \le x \gamma(n)) = (1 - \frac{ x^{-\alpha} }{n})^n = e^{-x^{-\alpha}}$ or $p(\max \frac{\xi_i}{ \gamma(n) } \le x ) = (1 - \frac{ x^{-\alpha} }{n})^n = e^{-x^{-\alpha}}$.

We've just shown that a random variable $a_n \xi + b_n$ converges to Frechet Type II EVD, where $a_n = \gamma(n)$ and $b_n = 0$.

#### Theorem 3.2: Von Mises sufficient condition for a distribution to belong to type III (Reversed Weibull) EVD

If a distribution function $F_{\xi}$ has a finite end point $x_F \le \infty$ and $\lim \limits_{x \to x_F} (x_F - x) r(x) = \alpha$,
then distribution $F_{\xi}$ belongs to type III (Reversed Weibull).

#### Proof:

If our original random variable $\xi$ had a finite upper end $x_F$, let us consider a derived random 
variable $\eta = \frac{1}{x_F - \xi}$.

$\eta$ approaches $+\infty$ as $\xi$ approaches upper end $x_F$ and approached $0+$ as $\xi$ approaches $-\infty$.

Let us look at the connection between c.d.f.s of $\eta$ and $\xi$:

$F_{\eta}(x) = p(\eta \le x) = p(\frac{1}{x_F - \xi} \le x) = p(\frac{1}{x} \le (x_F - \xi)) = p(\xi \le x_F - \frac{1}{x}) = F_{\xi}( x_F - \frac{1}{x} )$.

Basically, with $\eta$ we created a mapping of $\xi$ onto a $\{0, +\infty\}$ domain. Suppose that random variable $\eta$
fits the conditions of Theorem 3.1:

$\frac{x F'_{\eta}(x)}{ 1 - F_{\eta}(x) } = \frac{x F'_{\xi}(x_F - \frac{1}{x}) \frac{1}{x^2} }{1 - F_{\xi}(x_F - \frac{1}{x})} \xrightarrow{x \to \infty} \alpha$ 

Denote $y = x_F - \frac{1}{x}$, note that $\frac{1}{x} = x_F - y$ and substitute this into the previous result:

$\frac{ (x_F -y) \cdot F'_{\xi}(y) }{1 - F_{\xi}(y)}$

We came to the expression in the conditions of our theorem exactly, hence, $ \frac{ (x_F - y) \cdot F'_{\xi}(y) }{1 - F_{\xi}(y)} \xrightarrow{y \to x_F} \alpha$.

I.e. if and only if the conditions of this theorem are satisfied, $\eta$ is in the domain of attraction of Type II.

#### Theorem 3.3: Von Mises sufficient condition for a distribution to belong to type I (Gumbel) EVD

If a distribution function $F_{\xi}$ has a finite or infinite end point $x_F \le \infty$,
then distribution $F_{\xi}$ belongs to the domain of attraction of Type I (Gumbel) EVD if derivative of the hazard 
rate approaches zero $r'(u) = 0$ as $u \to x_F$ and hazard rate approaches a positive constant $r(u) \xrightarrow{u \to x_F} const$. 

Speaking informally, distribution of maximum converges to Gumbel, if the chances of death reach a 
plateau as $u \to x_F$.

**NOTE:** I've seen ~5 different formulations and proofs of this von Mises condition. This is the least generic, but
easiest in terms of understanding version in my opinion. I'll consider more general formulations after this proof. Here 
I am mostly following the formulation and logic of a proof by [Smith and Weissman](https://rls.sites.oasis.unc.edu/s834-2020/ExtremeValues.pdf), 
it is simpler than alternatives, which I discuss later. Those alternative proofs generalize this proof, giving rise to 
necessary and sufficient conditions, which I discuss in part 4.

#### Proof:

##### Step 1

We shall start the proof from the end to motivate our mathematical manipulations.

In Steps 2+ we are going to show that von Mises condition entails that $\frac{S(u + x g(u))}{S(u)} = e^{-x}$ as $u \to x_F$, 
where $g(u) = \frac{1}{r(u)}$ is the inverse of hazard rate (if introduction of this new entity $g(u)$ feels unjustified to you now, I agree, but trust 
me on this, it will make sense later). Assume this fact proven for now and let's see how the result 
of the theorem follows.

As before we are going to use the tail quantile function $\gamma(n)$ to show that this ratio of survival
functions converges to Gumbel distribution. Take $u = \gamma(n) \to x_F$ and substitute it into the ratio:

$\frac{S(\gamma(n) + x g(\gamma(n)))}{S(\gamma(n))} = \frac{S(\gamma(n) + x g(\gamma(n)))}{\frac{1}{n}} = n S(\gamma(n) + x f(\gamma(n))) = e^{-x}$. 

Hence, $S(\gamma(n) + x g(\gamma(n))) = 1 - F(\gamma(n) + x g(\gamma(n))) = \frac{e^{-x}}{n}$, 

$F(\gamma(n) + x g(\gamma(n))) = 1 - \frac{e^{-x}}{n}$ and 

$F^n(\gamma(n) + x g(\gamma(n))) = (1 - \frac{e^{-x}}{n})^n = e^{-e^{-x}}$.

Thus, $p(M_n \le \gamma(n) + x g(\gamma(n))) = p(\frac{M_n - \gamma(n)}{g(\gamma(n))} \le x) = F^n(\gamma(n) + x g(\gamma(n))) = e^{-e^{-x}}$, leading us to the desired result, Gumbel distribution.

##### Step 2

Having motivated our interest in the ratio $\frac{S(u + x g(u))}{S(u)}$ in step 1, let us connect it to hazard rate
and start showing the fact that this ratio converges to $e^{-x}$ as $u \to x_F$.

Recall the connection between cumulative hazard function $R(u)$, hazard rate $r(t)$ and survival function $S(u)$: 

$R(u) = \int \limits_{-\infty}^{u} r(t) dt = \overbrace{\cancel{\ln S(-\infty)}}^{=0} - \ln S(u)$

Hence, $\ln S(u + x g(u)) - \ln S(u) = \int \limits_{-\infty}^{u} \frac{1}{g(t)} dt - \int \limits_{-\infty}^{u + x g(u)} \frac{1}{g(t)} dt = - \int \limits_{u}^{u + x g(u)} \frac{1}{g(t)} dt$ and

$\frac{S(u + x g(u))}{S(u)} = e^{- \int \limits_{u}^{u + x g(u)} \frac{1}{g(t)} dt}$

##### Step 3

We need to show that $e^{- \int \limits_{u}^{u + x g(u)} \frac{1}{g(t)} dt} \xrightarrow{u \to x_F} e^{-x}$ and, hence, $\int \limits_{u}^{u + x g(u)} \frac{1}{g(t)} dt \xrightarrow{u \to x_F} x$.

Perform a variable substitution $s = \frac{t - u}{g(u)}$, $t = u + s g(u)$:

$\int \limits_{t=u}^{t = u + x g(u)} \frac{1}{g(t)} dt = \int \limits_{s=\frac{u-u}{f(u)}=0}^{s=\frac{u + x g(u) - u}{g(u)}=x} \frac{1}{g(u + s g(u))} d(u + s g(u)) = \int \limits_{s=0}^{x} \frac{g(u)}{g(u + s g(u))} ds$

We need to show that integrand $\frac{g(u)}{g(u + s g(u))}$ uniformly converges to $1$ as $u \to x_F$ in order to show that integral 
approximately equals $x$ because then $\int \limits_{0}^{x} \frac{g(u)}{g(u + s g(u))} ds \to \int \limits_{0}^{x} 1 ds = x$.

Uniform convergence implies that we can choose an arbitrarily small tolerance $\epsilon$, so that there would exist some
point $u_{\epsilon}$, such that for every value of $s$ inequality $| \frac{g(u)}{g(u + s g(u))} - 1 | \le \epsilon$ holds
for every point $u$, such that $u_{\epsilon} \le u \le x_F$, and, hence, 
$|\int \limits_{0}^{x} \frac{g(u)}{g(u + s g(u))} ds - \int \limits_{0}^{x} 1 ds| \le \epsilon x$. 

##### Step 4

We need to work out the approximation of $\frac{g(u)}{g(u + s g(u))}$ ratio.

For that end consider the Taylor series for $g(u + s g(u))$ around the point $u$:

$g(u + s g(u)) = g(u) + g'(u) s g(u) + O(s^2 g^2(u))$ and $g(u) \to const$, hence, $g(u + s g(u)) = g(u) + g'(u) s g(u) + O(s^2)$

Then $\frac{g(u + s g(u))}{g(u)} = 1 + g'(u) s + O(s^2)$. Assuming $x$ and, hence, $x$ small enough, we assume $O(s^2)$
can be made arbitrarily small.

Inverting numerator and denominator, we get $\frac{g(u)}{g(u + s g(u))} = \frac{1}{1 + s g'(u)}$

Integrating both sides: $\int \limits_{0}^{x} \frac{g(u)}{g(u + s g(u))} ds = \int \limits_{0}^{x} \frac{1}{1 + s g'(u)} ds = \int \limits_{0}^{x} \frac{1}{g'(u)} d \ln(1 + s g'(u)) = \ln(1 + x g'(u))^{\frac{1}{g'(u)}}$

Re-write this as $\ln(1 + \frac{x}{ 1/g'(u) })^{1/g'(u)}$. This looks familiar, right?

Denote $n = \frac{1}{g'(u)} \to \infty$ as $g'(u) \to 0$. We get $\ln (1 + \frac{x}{n})^n = \ln e^x = x$. This concludes the proof.

### Generalizations of Theorem 3.3: auxiliary function and von Mises function

As I said, there are multiple alternative formulations and proofs of von Mises conditions. Some use more generic notions
of **auxiliary function** and **von Mises function**.

The general necessary and sufficient conditions in the next part of this post build on top of these two notions. Hence, it
makes sense to discuss the generalizations of von Mises conditions here.

#### Definition 3.5: Auxiliary function

In the previous proof we denoted the inverse hazard rate as $g(x) = \frac{1}{r(x)}$. This quantity $g(x)$,
which is called **auxiliary funcion**, is defined in the context of the ratio $\frac{S(u + x g(u))}{S(u)}$ and is chosen 
in such a way that $\frac{S(u + x g(u))}{S(u)} \xrightarrow{u \to x_F} e^{-x}$.

However, turns out that it is not uniquely defined. We can make use of other definitions of $g(x)$ and convergence to 
Gumbel EVD would still hold.

To motivate other choices of auxiliary function let us discuss the interpretation of this ratio of survival functions. 
We can treat it as a conditional probability. The denominator represents the fraction of population that survived by the 
time $u$ close to the maximum lifespan. The numerator is the probability to survive for a (bit) longer period of 
time $x g(u)$, where auxiliary function $g(u)$ can be seen as some kind of normalization constant.

Then our ratio can be interpreted as conditional probability $p( \frac{\xi - u}{g(u)} > x | \xi > u)$. Basically it is
the change to live $x g(u)$ years longer among those who already survived $u$ years.

Consider a different popular choice of auxiliary function: $g(x) = \frac{\int \limits_{t}^{x_F} S(x) dx }{ S(t) }$. What
interpretation can we give to it?

Recall that the integral of survival function is average lifespan. Hence, $\frac{\int \limits_{t}^{x_F} S(x) dx }{ S(t) }$ 
is basically conditional expectation of longevity among those, who survived by the moment of time $t$: the denominator 
is the fraction of survivors by $t$, while the numerator is the average life expectancy of these survivors after moment 
of time $t$.

TODO: outline the generalization of von Mises conditions to a generic auxiliary function

#### Definition 3.6: von Mises function

TODO


#### Alternative formulation 1: hazard rate at end point is inverse of auxiliary function 1

First alternative formulation of von Mises condition is as follows.

For a distribution function $F_{\xi}$ regardless, if it has a finite, or an infinite end point, if 
$\lim \limits_{t \to x_F} r(t) g(t) = 1$, the distribution's maximum is in the domain of Gumbel Type I EVD.

This condition holds if and only if $F(x)$ is a von Mises function.

Here $g(t) = \frac{\int \limits_{t}^{x_F} S(x) dx }{ S(t) }$ is **auxiliary function** (as in the first example, conditional probability).

Then $b_n = \gamma(n)$ (tail quantile function) and $a_n = f(b_n)$ (auxiliary function of tail quantile function).

Please, refer to [Resnick](https://minerva.it.manchester.ac.uk/~saralees/book3.pdf) textbook for this version of proof,
but let me warn you that it is ugly and techincal.

#### Alternative formulation 2: derivative of hazard rate at upper end point approaches 0

$r'(x) \xrightarrow{x \to x_F} 0$

Again, this formulation makes use of auxiliary function $g(x) = \frac{\int \limits_{t}^{x_F} S(u)du}{S(t)}$, and again 
the proof is highly technical, hardly intelligible and not very instructive. 

Please, refer to [Resnick](https://minerva.it.manchester.ac.uk/~saralees/book3.pdf) or 
[Leadbetter](https://scask.ru/k_book_eps.php) textbooks for this version of proof (both are ugly).

#### Alternative formulation 3

$Q(x) =\frac{F''(x)(1 - F(x))}{(F'(x))^2} \xrightarrow{x \to x_F} -1$.

This is equivalent to previous formulation $r'(x) \to 0$ as $x \to x_F$ because

$r'(x) = \frac{F'(x)}{1 - F(x)} = F''(x) \frac{1}{1 - F(x)} + F'(x) \frac{F'(x)}{(1 - F(x))^2} = \frac{F''(x) (1 - F(x)) + (F'(x))^2}{(1 - F(x))^2}$

Now consider $r'(x) \cdot \frac{(1 - F(x))^2}{(F'(x))^2} = Q(x) + 1$, which is synonymous to previous formulation.


## 4. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a distribution to belong to a type I, II or III

Speaking informally: 

* If a distribution's survival function has no end point and its survival decays polynomially (has "fat tails"), the distribution belongs to EVD type II (Frechet).
* If a distribution's survival function has a finite end point, and it decays polynomially, approaching that end point, the distribution belongs to EVD type III (Weibull). 
* If a distribution's survival function decays exponentially (has "light, sub-exponential tails"), approaching its end point, which might be either finite or infinite, it belongs to EVD type I (Gumbel).

For instance:

* Pareto, Cauchy, Student and Fisher distributions have heavy tails and converge to Type II.
* Uniform and Beta distributions have a finite end point and converge to Type III.
* Gaussian, Exponential, Gamma and Logistic distributions have light sub-exponential tails and converge to Type I.

In case of Type I the end point might be finite or infinite. 

An example of distribution with infinite end point $x_F$ we can consider exponential distribution $F(x) = 1 - e^{-x}$ 
for $x > 0$. We can show that its maximum converges to Type I by choosing $a_n = 1$, $b_n = \log n$, so that we 
get $F^n(x + \log n) = (1 - e^{-(x + \log n)})^n = (1 - \frac{e^{-x}}{n})^n \to exp(e^{-x})$.

An example of distribution with a finite end point $x_F$ is from Gnedenko (1943) work:

$F(x) = \begin{cases} 0, x < 0 \\ 1 - \exp(\frac{-x}{1-x}), 0 \le x < 1 \\ 1, x \ge 1 \end{cases}$

and $a_n = \frac{1}{(1 + \log n)^2}$ and $b_n = \frac{ \log n }{ 1 + \log n }$

TODO: Gnedenko's example of a distribution that has $x_F < \infty$ and still decays sub-exponentially 

We shall formalize this theorem statement a bit later. But first, to perform the proof, we'll need more technical 
tool in our toolbox, **regularly varying function** (which is a generalization of a **slow-varying function**) and
**auxiliary function**.

### Karamata's theory of slow/regular/extended regular variation

TODO

#### Definition 4.1: Slow-varying function

**Slow-varying function** $l(x)$ is such a function that $\lim \limits_{t \to \infty} \frac{l(xt)}{l(t)} = 1$ for any $x > 0$.

#### Definition 4.2: Regularly-varying function

**Regularly-varying function** $h(x)$ of index $\gamma$ is such a function that $\lim \limits_{t \to \infty} \frac{h(xt)}{l(h)} = x^{\gamma}$ for any $x > 0$.

Regularly-varying function is basically just a generalization of slow-varying function.

Later on we will show that if the survival function of our distribution in question is regularly-varying, its maximum 
converges to Type III Weibull EVD, if it has a finite upper end point or to Type II Frechet EVD, if its upper end point
is infinite.

#### Definition 4.3: Extended regular variation

A measurable function is said to be of **extended regular variation**, if there exists a function $a(x)$, such that
$\lim \limits_{t \to \infty} \frac{f(tx) - f(t)}{a(x)} = \frac{x^{\alpha} - 1}{\alpha}$.

The function $a(x)$ is called **auxiliary function**.

$\lim \limits_{t \to \infty} \frac{ t f (t)}{ \int \limits_{t_0}^{t} f (s) ds } = \alpha + 1 $

If $\alpha < âˆ’1$, or $\alpha = âˆ’1$ and $\int \limits_0^{\infty} f (s) ds < \infty$, then

$\lim \limits_{t \to \infty} \frac{t f(t)}{ \int \limits_{t}^{\infty} f(s)ds } = - \alpha - 1$

#### Theorem 4.1: necessary and sufficient conditions for a distribution to belong to a type II or III EVD

* A distribution belongs to Extreme Value Distribution type II (Frechet) if and only if $x_F = \infty$ and $\lim \limits_{t \to \infty} \frac{S(tx)}{S(t)} = x^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha > 0$ and $x > 0$.
* A distribution belongs to Extreme Value Distribution type III (Weibull) if and only if $x_F < \infty$ and $\lim \limits_{t \to 0} \frac{S(x_F - tx)}{S(x_F - t)} = x^\alpha$, where $\alpha > 0$ and $x > 0$.

#### Proof:

##### EVD Type II

$F_{M_n}(tx) = p(M_n \le tx) = F_\xi(tx)^n = p(\xi_i \le tx)^n = (1 - p(\xi_i \ge tx))^n = (1 - S(tx))^n \to (1 - x^{-\alpha} S(t))^n = (1 - x^{-\alpha} \cdot \frac{1}{n})^n = e^{-{x^{-\alpha}}}$

A non-decreasing function U is $\Gamma$-varying (written U $\in$ $\Gamma$) if U is defined on an interval

such that for all x $\lim \limits_{t \to x_F} \frac{ U(t + xf(t)) }{ U(t) } = e^x$.

The function $f$ is called an **auxiliary function** and is unique up to asymptotic
equivalence. There are several ways to check this, but perhaps the most straightforward is to define for $t > 0$, $x > 0$ 

$F_t(x) = 1 - U(t)/U(t + x)$

so that $F_t(x)$ is a family of distributions. If this is satisfied for both $f_1$ and $f_2$ then:
