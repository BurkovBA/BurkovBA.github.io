description: Solution of quadratic programming problem in polynomial time by Soviet mathematicians in the late 1970s - early 1980s paved the way for several important machine learning methods of 1990s, such as Lasso/ElasticNet regression (with its L1 regularization) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These methods are incredibly useful, because they produce sparse solutions, effectively serving as a proxy for L0 regularization, in feature space/data point space respectively. Thanks to QP magic, they manage to do this in polynomial time, while straightforward application of L0 norm is NP-hard and cannot be done efficiently.
