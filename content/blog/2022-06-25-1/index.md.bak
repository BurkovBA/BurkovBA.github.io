description: For almost a century the field of signal processing existed in the paradigm of Nyquist-Shannon theorem (also known as Kotelnikov theorem in Russian literature) that claimed that you cannot extract more than n Fourier harmonics from a signal, if you have n measurements. However, thanks to the results in functional analysis from 1980s, such as Lindenstrauss-Johnson lemma and Kashin-Garnaev-Gluskin inequality, it became evident, that you can do with as few as log(n)! After application of the L1-norm machinery developed in 1990s, such as LASSO and LARS, a new groundbreaking theory of compressed sensing emerged in mid-2000s to early 2010s. In this post I'll briefly cover some of its ideas and results.
