description: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is the most fashionable method of matrix decomposition among productive, but mathematically illiterate biologists, much more popular than PCA due to its perceived simplicity. However, if you start digging deeper, it happens to have profound connections to a multitude of other techniques from linear algebra and matrix analysis. In this post I discuss those connections.

This post is inspired by a discussion in 

## Introduction to NMF and k-means

TODO

## Theorem 1. Maximum of Frobenius norm is minimum of truncated PCA

TODO

## Theorem 2. Biclustering problems can be re-formulated through quadratic programming

TODO

## Theorem 3. k-means corresponds to spectral clustering
