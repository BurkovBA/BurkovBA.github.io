## Deployment commands

CI/CD systems like Jenkins or GoCD nowadays are built by Java guys, who have this artifacts mentality and
assume that each step of build process is happening in a temporary sandbox environment in Jenkins agent
or go-agent project folder. It produces artifacts and should exit then.

I had to comply with this approach, so build process for this blog results in construction of a docker image
that I run on the machine and proxy the traffic to it through an Nginx proxy.

The build process is as follows:

 - `docker stop blog`
 - `docker build -t blog .`
 - `docker run -p <port>:<port> -rm -d --name blog blog`

## Building the frontend

This whole blog is a React SPA. It is built with webpack by running npm scripts in 3 environments:
development (using webpack-dev-server), production (serving a bundle to be executed in browser) and
server-side rendered (using express server).

Development environment is used on localhost, Github pages (BurkovBA.github.io) are serving the bundle
built for production environment, while borisburkov.net runs express server, which serves pre-rendered
page along with production bundle, that works on the frontend.

## How to make github pages serve this

I use a neat hack by Rafael Pedicini: https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages

It works as follows: when you request some url of your SPA, which doesn't correspond to any file in your
repository, Github server returns 404 error.

Here's the catch: you can customize your 404.html page! So, you create a custom 404 error with a script.
That script parses url that you passed, transforms path components into URL params (aka GET params) and
redirects to index.html. For instance, https://BurkovBA.github.io/blog?category=programming is
transformed into https://BurkovBA.github.io?p=blog&category=programming. index.html parses this path p
parameter back into a proper URL and initializes React SPA.


## Server-side rendering (SSR)

See the https://github.com/BurkovBA/BurkovBA.github.io/tree/master/src/server folder.

Again, this is a pretty neat code, mostly stolen from a couple of blogs:

 - https://medium.com/@phoebe.greig/headache-free-isomorphic-app-tutorial-react-js-react-router-node-js-ssr-with-state-and-es6-797a8d8e493a

## Telegram preview

I've written a page template for telegram to render, but so far it still doesn't recognize my page elements
unfortunately.

  Gatsby's blog starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this blog boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

_Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out our vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-blog-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
